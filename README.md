In this window you can specify a name for your project, the path on your computer where the new project will be created (by default all projects are created in <USER_FOLDER>/TestlumProjects/<PROJECT_NAME>).
You will also need to specify the Java version you want to use for future testing.

**3. Java installation**
If you have Java version 11 on your computer, you can skip this section. Otherwise you need to install version 11 directly from the Testlum IDE.
Simply click on the JDK box and select 'Download JDK...'.
